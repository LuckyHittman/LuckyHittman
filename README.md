Hello World!
I'm initially not a developer, programmer, coder etc...whatever your word choice would be for me...but stumbled into a passion the past 5 years exploring data. I live in the state of WI and have created an account here to develop some skills. Some of my passions include running, computers, reading, philosophy and data. I believe almost all of the world's problems could be solved if folks slowed down and really thought critically upon a lot of things.

Also, a lot of decisions need to be data-driven and not simply "because." If we as a Nation [USA] simply voted/elected/hired/etc... based on a gut feeling and doing what feels right as opposed to what is actually needed, there is no hope and longevity for progress. Because you have a passion for something and there is a financial or physical barrier for you to complete it, doesn't mean you're entitled to have the same access as those who can. It is what it is (btw, I really hate using and hearing that phrase).

Five Truths of the World According to Me

1. The world isn't fair, and you cannot expect others to make it fair for you.
2. Fortune favours the bold- if you want it, make it happen.
3. Our greatest power is the ability to choose freely.
4. Be like children in the world, yet not ignorant like children, be colour-blind in friend choices
5. Money doesn't matter, you can't bring it with you upon death, and ultimately, legacy doesn't matter either as all things are ephermal.
